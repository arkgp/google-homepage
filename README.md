This project replicate the Google homepage as an exercise to practice the fundamentals of HTML and CSS with some very basic Javascript.

We haven't learn the best practices for properly structuring HTML, CSS and Javascript code yet, so I tried to come up with a reasonable approach.

The CSS is structured with the selectors in alphabetical order. Each selector is separated into two groups. The first one is all properties related to the layout and elements' position and the second group is for the styling. 

The file is further divided into two section: 

1. Basic structure and layout 

2. Specific states (hover, active and focus).
